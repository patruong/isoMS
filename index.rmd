### 14:27 More tools, pyopenms and previous run of conversion to .mzML was bad
Previous run conversion run with msconvert was bad. Just reran the code without peakPicking filter.

Checked out pyopenms. It works on my desktop, but there is an error related to QT5 on my laptop when running on spyder (why?). 

I got the suggestion to use dinosaur as a peakPicker and try different peakPicking filters from it. 

ToDo:
- check if Percolator applicable at some step here?
- check how to run dinosaur. 
- peakPick with dinosaur. 
- Script code to generate some exploratory plots with .mzML files.
- Check if pandas-profiling can be useful.

### 23:27 Finished data conversion to .mzML
Just used msconvert to convert the .raw data to .mzML. The only filter used is pickPeaking msLevel=1-2. The end file size are much smaller than expected even though I've been told they are expected to be larger than the .raw files. Am I doing something wrong?

I will try pyopenms to open these .mzML files.

Setting up a Rmarkdown log for this project.
