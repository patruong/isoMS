### 23:27 Finished data conversion to .mzML
Just used msconvert to convert the .raw data to .mzML. The only filter used is pickPeaking msLevel=1-2. The end file size are much smaller than expected even though I've been told they are expected to be larger than the .raw files. Am I doing something wrong?

I will try pyopenms to open these .mzML files.

Setting up a Rmarkdown log for this project.
